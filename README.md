# Shared Actions

This repository stores reusable workflows that are used for our internal projects and repositories. Reusable workflows are currently stored at the root of the [.github/workflows](./.github/workflows/) directory, per limitations imposed by GitHub. Practical examples of workflow usage can be found in the [examples](./examples/) directory.
